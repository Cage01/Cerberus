	*	via their Level reference and
	*	Components do this either via their
	*	Actor owner or the World theyâ€™ve been
	*	registered with. Each other Object
	*	type has to find its own path back to
	*	World, often through a reference to an
	*	Actor.
	*
	*	If you want to be able to call
	*	GetWorld on your class, you need to
	*	override the function and provide a
	*	valid path to a World.
