# Setup

- Download and install Unreal Engine 5.1
- Right click on the Cerberus.uproject file in this directory and select **Generate Visual Studio project files**
- Once generated you can open the project either by opening the `Cerberus.sln` file, which will open the C++ source code, or with the `Cerberus.uproject` file which will open the Unreal Editor



**When opening the project for the first time be sure to change the net mode to "Client" As a lot of functionality wont be functional if the game isnt playing in a multiplayer state**
